# Types of Vulnerabilities

While Rust is designed with a strong emphasis on safety, it is not immune to certain types of vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities often arise from user errors or oversights and can pose significant security risks. It's important to note that the vulnerabilities discussed in this section are not exhaustive, and there may be other types of vulnerabilities that are not covered here. However, the following are some of the most common program-independent, user-specific vulnerabilities encountered in Rust:

## SQL Injection

SQL injection is a code injection technique that attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities in a web application's database layer. This vulnerability can occur when user input is incorrectly filtered or parameterized, allowing the attacker to manipulate SQL queries. Despite Rust's safety features, SQL injection can still occur if user input is not properly handled.

## Command Injection

Command injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system. This can occur in Rust when user input is used to construct system commands without proper sanitization or validation.

## Integer Overflow

Integer overflow is a type of arithmetic overflow error that occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits. Rust has some protections against integer overflow in debug mode, but these checks are not present in release mode for performance reasons.

## Resource Exhaustion/Leakage

Resource exhaustion, also known as a resource leak, occurs when a program does not properly manage system resources. In Rust, this can occur due to improper use of memory, file descriptors, or other system resources. This can lead to a degradation in system performance or even a system crash if the resource exhaustion is severe enough.

In the following sections, we will delve into each of these vulnerabilities, providing an in-depth analysis of their nature, potential impacts, and the preventive measures that can be adopted to safeguard against them.
