# Overview

Program-independent, user-specific vulnerabilities in Rust refer to security vulnerabilities that are not tied to the specific design or implementation of a program but rather stem from user errors or oversights. These vulnerabilities can occur in any program, regardless of the programming language used, and are often a result of poor coding practices, lack of understanding of the language's features, or failure to adhere to secure coding guidelines.

In the context of Rust, these vulnerabilities can manifest in several ways, including SQL injection, command injection, integer overflow, and resource exhaustion/leakage. Despite Rust's emphasis on memory safety and zero-cost abstractions, these vulnerabilities can still pose significant security risks, leading to potential breaches and system failures.

In the subsequent sections, we delve into each of these vulnerabilities, providing an in-depth analysis of their nature, potential impacts, and the preventive measures that can be adopted to safeguard against them. Through this analysis, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of program-independent, user-specific vulnerabilities in Rust, thereby equipping developers and security analysts with the knowledge and tools to enhance the security of their Rust applications.
