# Introduction

Rust, a modern, high-performance programming language, has gained significant attention in recent years for its memory safety and zero-cost abstractions. While it is designed to be safe, concurrent, and practical, it is not immune to security vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these vulnerabilities, focusing on both program-independent, user-specific vulnerabilities and program-specific vulnerabilities.
