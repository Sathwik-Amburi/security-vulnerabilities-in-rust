# Objective of the Study

The primary objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of security vulnerabilities in Rust. We aim to delve into both program-independent, user-specific vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, integer overflow, and resource exhaustion/leakage, as well as program-specific vulnerabilities that pertain to Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in Rust.

Through a series of case studies, we aim to illustrate real-world instances of these vulnerabilities, thereby providing a practical perspective to our theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we seek to synthesize our findings into actionable insights and recommendations for secure coding practices in Rust.
