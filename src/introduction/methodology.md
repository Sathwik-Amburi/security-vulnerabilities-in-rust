# Methodology

Our study is based on a systematic review of existing literature and case studies related to security vulnerabilities in Rust. We have structured our paper into several sections, each focusing on a distinct aspect of these vulnerabilities. We begin with an analysis of program-independent, user-specific vulnerabilities, followed by an exploration of program-specific vulnerabilities. Each section provides an in-depth analysis of the vulnerabilities, their potential impacts, and the preventive measures that can be adopted.

In addition to these, we have included a series of case studies that illustrate real-world instances of these vulnerabilities. The discussion section synthesizes the key findings from our study, outlines their implications for developers and security analysts, and provides recommendations for secure coding practices in Rust.

Through this methodology, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of the security vulnerabilities in Rust, serving as a valuable resource for developers, security analysts, and anyone interested in enhancing the security of their Rust applications.
