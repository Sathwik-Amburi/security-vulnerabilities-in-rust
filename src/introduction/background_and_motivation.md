# Background and Motivation

The advent of Rust has brought about a paradigm shift in the world of programming. Its unique safety features and zero-cost abstractions have made it a preferred choice for developers, particularly for system programming, embedded systems, and other areas where performance, reliability, and safety are paramount. However, like any other programming language, Rust is not devoid of security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities, if not addressed, can pose significant security risks, leading to potential breaches and system failures.

Understanding these vulnerabilities, their origins, impacts, and preventive measures is crucial for developers and security analysts. It not only helps in enhancing the security of Rust applications but also contributes to the ongoing discourse on secure coding practices. This forms the motivation for our study.
