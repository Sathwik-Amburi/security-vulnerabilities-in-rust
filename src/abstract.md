# Abstract

This literature survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of security vulnerabilities in Rust, a modern, high-performance programming language renowned for its memory safety and zero-cost abstractions. The paper is divided into two main sections, each focusing on a distinct type of security vulnerability.

The first section of the paper focuses on program-independent, user-specific vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, and other similar threats. Despite Rust's robust safety features, these vulnerabilities often arise from user errors or oversights and can pose significant security risks. This section provides an in-depth analysis of these vulnerabilities, their potential impacts, and the preventive measures that can be adopted to safeguard against them.

The second section delves into Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and program-specific vulnerabilities in Rust. It scrutinizes the nature of these vulnerabilities, their origins, and the potential risks they pose. This section also explores the various mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent such vulnerabilities, with a particular emphasis on the unique safety features and paradigms inherent to Rust.

Through a systematic review of existing literature and case studies, this paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of the security vulnerabilities in Rust. It serves as a valuable resource for developers, security analysts, and anyone interested in enhancing the security of their Rust applications. The insights gleaned from this study will contribute to the ongoing discourse on secure coding practices and the evolution of Rust as a secure programming language.
