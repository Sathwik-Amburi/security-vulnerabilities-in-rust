# Abstract

This literature survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of security vulnerabilities in Rust, a modern, high-performance programming language renowned for its memory safety and zero-cost abstractions. The paper is structured into several sections, each focusing on a distinct aspect of security vulnerabilities in Rust.

The first major section of the paper focuses on program-independent, user-specific vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, integer overflow, and resource exhaustion/leakage. Despite Rust's robust safety features, these vulnerabilities often arise from user errors or oversights and can pose significant security risks. This section provides an in-depth analysis of these vulnerabilities, their potential impacts, and the preventive measures that can be adopted to safeguard against them.

The second major section delves into Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and program-specific vulnerabilities in Rust. It scrutinizes the nature of these vulnerabilities, their origins, and the potential risks they pose. This section also explores the various mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent such vulnerabilities, with a particular emphasis on the unique safety features and paradigms inherent to Rust.

In addition to these two main sections, the paper includes a series of case studies that illustrate real-world instances of these vulnerabilities. The discussion section synthesizes the key findings from the study, outlines their implications for developers and security analysts, and provides recommendations for secure coding practices in Rust.

Through a systematic review of existing literature and case studies, this paper aims to provide a holistic understanding of the security vulnerabilities in Rust. It serves as a valuable resource for developers, security analysts, and anyone interested in enhancing the security of their Rust applications. The insights gleaned from this study will contribute to the ongoing discourse on secure coding practices and the evolution of Rust as a secure programming language.
